    <h2>How is Bomellida celebrated?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Bomellida</strong>, unlike many other holidays, does not have candle-lighting traditions (but you in fact <strong>can</strong> light candles or get warm because it's the winter and it's <em>cold</em>, it is not explicitly listed off as what not to do, but it is seen as <strong>weird and even rude</strong> to light candles in <em>some</em> countries because the holiday lacks a candle-lighting tradition in general, but most do not really mind), despite the <em>Spanish</em>-sounding name (even though it is <strong>Latin</strong>, and saying it is <em>Spanish</em>-sounding is slightly <strong>offensive</strong>). But for the answer, people typically celebrate by giving candy, like chocolate, or lollipops, to family members or friends, and also typically say "<strong>Happy Bomellida!</strong>" after giving the candy.
